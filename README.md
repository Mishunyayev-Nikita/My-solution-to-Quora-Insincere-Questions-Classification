## My solution Quora Insincere Questions Classification 2018-2019

I with my friend ranked ???st (TOP ???%) in the [Quora Insincere Questions Classification on Kaggle platform.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/leaderboard). We tried many neural network architectures in this competition, but we achieved our two best results by ... . It was an interesting competition, primarily because I had never used recurrent and convolutional neural networks before. Also, the public leaderboard is calculated with approximately 15% of the test data and private with 85%, which led to a large shake up, but ??? .

## In this repository you can find:
* `rnn.py` - **Reccurent neural network** with Attention, bidirectional LSTM and bidirectional GRU layers
* `rcnn.py` - **Recurrent convolutional neural network** with bidirectional LSTM, bidirectional GRU, Conv1d and pooling layers (average and max)
* `training.ipynb` - notebook with data preprocessing (text cleaning, getting meta features) and training two neural networks
